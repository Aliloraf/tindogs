# TinDogs

Based on the popular dating app Tinder, Tindogs is an app that connects adoption agencies and potential adopters.

- Adoption agencies can create profiles for their animals, then post individual profiles for each animal in need of adoption. Details like age, physical description, and status of health is included in this profile so that adoptees can understand what the animal is like.

- The potential adopters can also create a profile where they specify their lifestyle, location and various other details. 

- The employees of a pet adoption center are responsible for matching pets with potential adopters. 

> The Tindogs app not only makes pet adoption easy and effective, but it also strives to help with the current mental health crisis. <br> <br> Numerous studies have shown the benefits of having a pet around the house: pets love their owners with unconditional love (with the obvious exception of cats...) and this kind of devotion can have a lasting positive impact on their owners.
